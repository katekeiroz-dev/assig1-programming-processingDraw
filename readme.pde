Brief description:
=================

The night and day city is a illustrate draw I've developed for my Programming Fundamentals  module in my Hidp in Computer Science course. I developed this illustrate draw using processing software sketchbook .



Instructions:
=============

To run the program ;
- dowload the zip file 
- unzip  KateKeiroz folder 
- open processing software
- go to file > Open > "folder KateKeiroz" > code.pde > open
- hit run bottom on top left 

The interactive features in the program is toggle between dat/night, with  the mousePressed event that activate whether a mouse button has been pressed. So when you click within the draw image it changes scene from day to night.
